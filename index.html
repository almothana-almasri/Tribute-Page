          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            Ahmed Zewail (26 February 1946 – 2 August 2016) was an Egyptian scientist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1999 for his pioneering work in femtochemistry. He was the Linus Pauling Chair professor of chemistry, professor of physics, and the director of the Physical Biology Center for Ultrafast Science and Technology at the California Institute of Technology.

            Born in Damanhur, Egypt, Zewail earned a Bachelor's and Master's degree from Alexandria University before moving to the United States to pursue his Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania. He then did his postdoctoral work at the University of California, Berkeley, and worked as a faculty member at the University of California, Berkeley, and the California Institute of Technology.

            Zewail's groundbreaking work in femtochemistry allowed scientists to observe chemical reactions taking place at the scale of femtoseconds (10^-15 seconds), providing new insights into the fundamental processes of chemistry.

            <p>“When I was a child, I thought of my Delta town as the center of the universe, but now I realize how little I know about the universe. As a child, I thought I was immortal, but now I recognize how limited a time we all have. As a child, success meant scoring A on every exam, but now I take it to mean good health, close family and friends, achievements in my work, and helping others.”<br>
